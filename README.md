# Process Scheduler Benchmarking

This program demonstrates the use of Linux's scheduling policies for different processes. It creates three child processes, each of which performs a counting task. The goal is to benchmark these processes based on different scheduling policies and priorities. The execution times for each process are measured, and the results are displayed in a histogram.

## Introduction
This program creates three child processes and assigns them different scheduling policies and priorities. Each child process performs a counting task from 1 to 2<sup>32</sup>. The parent process measures the execution times of these child processes and displays the results in a histogram.

## How to Run the Application
1. **Prequisites:**
   - Linux based OS.
   - GCC compiler on the system.
   - Linux-header files on the system.

2. **Cloning the Repository:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/regular-life/OS-Assignments.git
     ```
     **OR**
   - Download the .zip file from https://github.com/regular-life/OS-Assignments.
   
3. **Opening the Project:**
   - Unzip the file and navigate to "Assignment-2" -> "Ques3".
   - Right-click on the screen and select "Go to terminal here" (or any other similar option).

4. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the program using the provided Makefile:
     ```bash
     make all
     ```

5. **Execution:**
   - Run the program using the following command:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```

6. **View Results:**
   - After execution, the program generates a histogram to compare the execution times of processes with different scheduling policies.
   - The histogram is displayed using Python and Matplotlib.

7. **Delete executables:**
   - Delete the executables using the following:
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```

## Process Descriptions
1. **Process 1 (SCHED_OTHER):**
   - This process uses the `SCHED_OTHER` scheduling policy with standard priority `(nice: 0)`.

2. **Process 2 (SCHED_RR):**
   - This process uses the `SCHED_RR` scheduling policy with default priority.

3. **Process 3 (SCHED_FIFO):**
   - This process uses the `SCHED_FIFO` scheduling policy with default priority.

## Compilation and Execution
The program is compiled using the provided `Makefile`, and the `a.out` executable is generated. `taskset` has been used to ensure that the program runs only on 1 processor - processor number 3.

## Error Handling
The program includes error handling for various scenarios, such as failed `fork()` operations. Error messages are printed to `stderr` in case of errors.

## Conclusion
This program demonstrates the use of different scheduling policies in Linux for managing and benchmarking processes. By comparing the execution times of processes with different scheduling policies, it provides insights into process scheduling in the Linux operating system.
